    <p>Compound interest is a powerful force in the world of finance. Unlike
      simple interest, which is calculated only on the initial amount of money,
      compound interest takes into account the accumulated interest from
      previous periods.

        <p> As a result, over time, the interest earned or paid
        becomes a larger portion of the overall balance, leading to exponential
        growth. For investments, compound interest means that your money earns
        interest not just on the initial investment, but also on the interest it
        has already earned. This compounding effect can lead to substantial growth
        in the value of your investment over extended periods. On the flip side,
        compound interest can work against borrowers who have loans with interest
        that compounds. Over time, the amount of interest added to the loan can
        accumulate, making it more challenging to pay off the debt. In summary,
        compound interest is a crucial concept in financial planning, investment,
        and borrowing. It highlights the potential for wealth accumulation through
        consistent saving and smart investment choices, as well as the importance
        of understanding the impact of interest on loans and debts.</p>
